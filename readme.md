Get user's playtime of a game on Steam with [DecAPI Steam API](https://docs.decapi.me/steam) **without providing Steam app id**.  
Useful for custom chatbot commands and Twitch integration.

&nbsp;

# Dependencies  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
- [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got)  

&nbsp;

# Getting Started  

1. Clone this repo.  
2. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`  
3. Create a `.env` file on the root directory.  
4.  Set your Steam user ID and (optional) [Steam API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) in the .env file.  
5. Run the server: `node server`  
6. Fastify server will run on port `3000`.

# Usage

Once the server is started, the API can be called through `/playtime/<GAME_NAME>`.  
Expected response:

```
    Gaben has been playing NEKOPARA Vol. 1 for 6.83 hours.
```  

&nbsp;

# Recommended Usage  

[Nightbot](https://nightbot.tv/) is capable of using the API seamlessly by calling the built-in [command](https://docs.nightbot.tv/commands/game) `!game`.  
As Nightbot returns the title of the game, a custom command can be created to call the API.  

For instance: A custom command `!playtime` internally calls the `!game` command, and using the response to call this API.  

```
    !playtime
```

The command above is expected to return the streamer's playtime of the streamed game in the chat.
